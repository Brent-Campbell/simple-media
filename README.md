# simiple-media

## Overview
For this assignment, you will make a web page that uses different types of media files.  

*Important*: As you build this page, be careful in the use of content that belongs to others. Unless you have created the content yourself, I expect that you will only use content from others with permission and include appropriate acknowledgements for the content creators.


## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [simple-media](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/simple-media).

The repository contains the standard Readme.md and .gitignore files and an empty index.html file.


## Requirements
Create a web page that demonstrates your ability to include multimedia files on your website. The web page should include:

- a short video (preferably one you make yourself)
- an audio clip
- an iframe with a youtube video
- an image styled with the CSS3 Transform property to look like a [Polaroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_film) picture
